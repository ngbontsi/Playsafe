# additional information
when developing the application I had some copmuter issues where the computer froze
I had to restart it to continue n my commits you will see when we introduced testing there's some time gap 
the computer is not competable to run heavy applications like IDE's but coding was written blindly without testng for runtime errors
(to save time as requested to be done in 60 min)
